Finally I am Done Coding Zerodha's Landing Page

--> It took me whole 8hrs of continuous coding to 
build this page from scratch. 
--> I have only made Frontend until now, and that 
also of Zerodha's Landing Page's 1st view only.
--> Until now this web page is made using only 
raw HTML and CSS. 
--> The landing page is fully responsive, and it 
is perfectly usable for all screen sizes. 

P.S.: While building this web page I learnt I a lot 
of new things, and it was totally worth it.
